Work experience
======
* Summer 2015: Research Assistant
  * Github University
  * Duties included: Tagging issues
  * Supervisor: Professor Git


* 03/2021-10/2021: REU Researcher, NLP and Algorithmic Fairness
  * REU Program, University of Michigan
  * Collected data from Enron dataset; cleaned and extracted email messages and labels using Pandas; used Na√Øve Bayes to identify the gender (the accuracy is around 80%).
  * Used numerical values to represent the effect of n-grams on the gender prediction; statistically analyzed the relationship between the usage of certain symbols & phrases and the gender of authors; empirically found that some common stopwords and punctuations are indeed signals and are statistically significant in prediction; made a checking tool for users to revise their writings to the gendered language.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Martin Strauss, Math and EECS Dept. of UMich


* 05/2021-09/2021: REU Researcher - Deep Learning and PDE                                           
  * REU Program, Texas Tech University
  * Learned deep learning, optimization, PDE; used ResNet to solve PDE; combined random feature model and ResNet to solve PDE.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Chunmei Wang from Texas Tech Uni. and Prof. Haizhao Yang from Purdue Uni.


* 12/2020-Present: Research Assistant - Cyber Risk and Computational Complexity                                        
  * University of Michigan
  * Duties included: Worked on privacy trading ecosystems by studying the computational complexity of such systems and designing systems with less complexity; worked on cyber (re)-insurance underwriting problem, and proved it to be NP-hard by reducing it to the k-densest subgraph problem.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Ranjan Pal, EECS Dept. of UMich
